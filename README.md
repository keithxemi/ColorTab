# ColorTab

A single html file web application using javascript and a custom font to create a new compact music notation system called ColorTab.

Conventional ascii tablature can be input from text file or copy/paste and converted to the new notation. Specialized editing is included with a palette of musical symbols for display and playback control.

The application contains images, audio, and fonts encoded in base64. It does not require connection to Internet servers, but can use Benjamin Gleitzman's package of [pre-rendered sound fonts](https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts). Portions of Daniel GÃ³mez Blasco's [sound-font player](https://github.com/danigb/soundfont-player) are included in the javascript.
